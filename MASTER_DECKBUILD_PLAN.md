# Master Deck Builder Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation — Tags in the DB

### 1.1: Clean up local tree — DONE

- Created `feature/phase1-tags` branch from `origin/main` (schema v32).
- Experiment work preserved on `agent-printing-ids` branch (commit `125df78`):
  WIP commit with schema v31 (deck_note, salt_scores, card_tags, plan +
  deck_label), cache salt command, deck detail UI overhaul, DeckRepository
  plan/note/label support, tag_descriptions updates, archidekt exporter.
  **These migrations will need to be renumbered** when applied to main
  (main is at v32; the WIP used v28-v31 for different features).
- `tag_all_cards.json` (4.4 MB, 151 tags, 115k pairs) is untracked and
  carried over — source of truth for tag data.
- Experiment scripts (`scripts/fetch_tag_cards*.py`, `scripts/test_*.py`,
  etc.) are untracked and preserved in the working directory.

### 1.2: Load Scryfall tags into `card_tags` — DONE

- Added `card_tags` table as schema v33 migration.
- `mtg cache tags` command fetches all tags from Scryfall API (~12 min),
  or loads from a local JSON file with `--file tag_all_cards.json`.
- `mtg cache all` automatically runs tag loading after card/printing cache
  (uses `~/.mtgc/tag_all_cards.json` if present for fast path).
- Only inserts tags for oracle_ids that exist in local `cards` table.

### 1.3: Tag search on the Collection page — DONE

- Server: added correlated subquery `(SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(ct.tag) ...)`
  to all 3 collection query variants (normal, include-unowned base/full).
  Returns `card_tags` array on each card JSON object.
- Client: added Tag multi-select filter in sidebar (same pattern as
  Set/Subtype). Tags populated from loaded data. Filters use AND logic
  (card must have ALL selected tags). Wired into clear/hasAnyFilter.

### 1.4: Ship it — DONE

Deploy via standard `deploy/deploy.sh`. Run `mtg cache tags` on the
deployed instance to populate.

## Phase 2: Deck Creation UI — DONE

### 2.1: Clean up decks.html — DONE

Current state: `decks.html` has list view (deck grid) and detail view (card
grid with category pills, mana curve). API endpoints exist in
`crack_pack_server.py`: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE for `/api/decks` and
`/api/decks/{id}/cards`.

**New user flow:**
1. User lands on `/decks` → sees deck list (existing).
2. "New Commander Deck" button → modal or inline form.
3. User searches their collection for a General (text input, autocomplete
   against owned legendary creatures).
4. Selecting a General calls `POST /api/decks` with the commander name.
5. Redirect to deck detail view showing the empty deck with commander.

**Server changes:**
- `POST /api/decks` already exists. May need to accept `commander_name` and
  call `DeckBuilderService.create_deck()` which validates commander legality,
  assigns the best owned copy, and creates the deck.
- Add `GET /api/collection/search?q=...&type=legendary+creature` for
  commander search (or reuse existing collection search with type filter).

**Client changes:**
- Add "New Deck" button to deck list view.
- Commander search modal with text input → fetch results → select → create.
- Wire existing detail view to show the new deck.

### 2.2: Ship it — DONE

## Phase 3: Deck Planning — DONE

### 3.1: "Make a Deck Plan" — DONE

From the deck detail view (with commander selected, deck mostly empty), user
clicks "Generate Plan". This calls Claude to create deck plan options.

**Template**: `architecture/COMMANDER_DECK_TEMPLATE.md` — Command Zone
99-card breakdown:
- 38 lands, 10 ramp, 12 card advantage, 12 targeted removal, 6 board wipes,
  ~25 standalone, ~10 enhancers, ~7 enablers.
- CMC curve targets and commander-based adjustments (Episode 659).

**Server side:**
- `POST /api/decks/{id}/plan` — sends commander info + template to Claude,
  asks for 2-3 plan variants (e.g. "aggressive", "controlling", "combo").
- Each plan is a JSON object with category slot counts (may deviate from
  template based on commander abilities) and a short strategy description.
- Uses `DeckBuilderService.set_plan()` to store the chosen plan.
- SSE streaming for the Claude response (same pattern as ingest processing).

**Client side:**
- "Generate Plan" button in deck detail header.
- Display plan options as cards/tabs. User picks one.
- Selected plan shows as a checklist in the sidebar: category → target count
  → current count.

**Claude prompt includes:**
- Commander name, colors, oracle text, mana cost.
- The template slot counts as a starting point.
- Commander adjustment rules (e.g. "commander provides draw → reduce card
  advantage slots").
- Ask for specific strategy/theme and how slot counts should be adjusted.

### 3.2: Ship it — DONE

---

## Phase 3.5: Fix Plan to use real tags — DONE

### Problem
Plan generation asked Claude for abstract categories (`ramp`,
`card_advantage`, `standalone`, etc.) — not real tag names from `card_tags`.
The whole point of the plan is to produce targets in terms of tags so
autofill can look them up directly. No mapping layer should be needed.

### Fix (completed)
- Changed Claude prompt to include all available tags from DB.
- Targets are now **real tag names** with numeric counts.
- Sums are >99 because cards have multiple tags (expected overlap).
- `_get_plan_progress()` simplified: counts by tag, "lands" by type line.
- UI displays tag names directly (no hardcoded category labels).
- Test fixture now seeds card_tags from `tag_all_cards.json`.
- Canned plan result saved for future test mocking.

### Verified
Tested with Stonebrow, Krosan Hero — Claude returned real tags:
`ramp`, `mana-rock`, `draw`, `boardwipe`, `evasion`, `synergy-token`,
`gives-evasion`, `anthem`, `combat-trick`, etc.

## Phase 4: Autofill — DONE

### 4.1: Fill deck from plan + tags — DONE

Given a plan (tag-based targets) and the user's collection, automatically
select cards to fill each tag target.

**How it works:**
1. For each tag target in the plan, query `card_tags` JOIN `collection` for
   owned cards matching that tag, filtered by commander color identity.
2. Rank candidates using a **composite score** (see below).
3. Fill up to the target count for each tag. Cards already in the deck
   are excluded. A card used in one tag target isn't reused in another.

**Composite ranking score (autofill weights):**

| Signal              | Weight | Source                                | Direction       | Notes |
|---------------------|--------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| EDHREC popularity   | 0.20   | `raw_json $.edhrec_rank`              | lower = better  | Primary signal for card quality |
| Bling               | 0.25   | frame_effects, full_art, promo        | higher = better | Full-art, borderless, extended art, showcase |
| Random              | 0.25   | uniform random [0,1)                  | —               | Keeps suggestions fresh across runs |
| Uniqueness          | 0.10   | inverse EDHREC rank                   | higher = better | Less popular cards make games more interesting |
| Recency             | 0.10   | `sets.released_at`                    | newer = better  | Fresher cards feel more fun |
| Salt / annoyance    | 0.05   | `salt_scores.salt_score`              | lower = better  | Avoid grief cards |
| Monetary value      | 0.05   | `raw_json $.prices.usd`              | higher = better | Proxy for power level |
| Cross-functionality | 0.00   | disabled                              | —               | Tag count rewards Scryfall tag noise, not real multi-role |

Phase 5 (card replacement) will expose weight tuning to the user.

### 4.2: Haiku tag validation — DONE

Scryfall tags have significant false positives (e.g. "Demystify" tagged
`boardwipe`, "Grove of the Burnwillows" tagged `mana-rock`). Haiku
validates ALL of a card's tags on first encounter during autofill, caching
results in `card_tag_validations` (schema v35). Future queries are instant
cache hits.

- Overfetches 3x candidates to account for filtering.
- SSE streaming shows per-card validation progress in the UI.
- Backfill logic handles cards partially validated from earlier runs.
- Without API key, suggestions are shown unvalidated with a warning banner.
- Tag hints in `TAG_ROLE_HINTS` give Haiku precise definitions (e.g. ramp
  requires NET INCREASE in mana sources — fetchlands are not ramp).

**Server side:**
- `POST /api/decks/{id}/autofill` — SSE stream with progress events,
  returns proposed additions grouped by tag.
- Does NOT auto-commit. Returns suggestions for user to review.
- `POST /api/decks/{id}/cards` (existing) to actually add approved cards.

**Client side:**
- "Autofill" button in deck detail view (only enabled when a plan exists).
- Shows proposed cards per tag with checkboxes. User can accept/reject
  individual suggestions.
- "Add Selected" button commits chosen cards to the deck.

## Phase 5: Card Replacement

### 5.1: Replace a card and get suggestions

User selects a card in their deck and says "replace this". System suggests
alternatives from the collection.

**How it works:**
1. Look up the card being removed — get its tags from `card_tags`.
2. Find other owned cards with overlapping tags, same color identity
   constraint, not already in this deck.
3. Rank using the same composite score as autofill, **plus** tag overlap
   (more shared tags = more similar role) and mana value proximity.
4. Present top N suggestions.
5. User can adjust ranking weights (e.g. prefer uniqueness over popularity,
   or prefer budget cards over expensive ones).

**Server side:**
- `GET /api/decks/{id}/cards/{collection_id}/replacements` — returns ranked
  list of replacement candidates with their tags and why they match.
- Accepts optional weight overrides as query params.

**Client side:**
- Right-click or button on a card in deck view → "Find Replacement".
- Sidebar or modal shows replacement candidates with weight sliders.
- Clicking one does a swap (remove old, add new) via existing API.

## Phase 6: Intelligent Land Autofill

### 6.1: Color-fixing land selection

Current `fill_lands` just counts mana pips and distributes basics
proportionally. This works but ignores the user's owned dual lands,
fetch lands, utility lands, and color-fixing needs.

**How it works:**
1. Analyze the deck's color requirements: pip counts per color, number of
   cards with demanding costs (e.g. {W}{W}{W}, {U}{U}), curve by color.
2. Query owned lands: duals, fetches, shocks, check lands, pain lands,
   filter lands, utility lands — anything that produces colored mana.
3. Prioritize color-fixing lands that cover the deck's weakest colors or
   most demanding costs. A 4-color deck with heavy white pips needs more
   white sources than a splash color.
4. Fill remaining slots with basics proportional to pip distribution.
5. Suggest utility lands (Command Tower, Reliquary Tower, etc.) from the
   user's collection.

**Ranking signals for lands:**
- Number of colors produced (more = better for multicolor decks)
- Enters untapped vs tapped (untapped = better)
- Covers weak colors (colors with few sources relative to pip demand)
- Fetchable by other lands in the deck (e.g. shocks are fetchable)
