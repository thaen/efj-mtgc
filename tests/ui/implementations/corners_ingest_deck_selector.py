"""
Hand-written implementation for corners_ingest_deck_selector.

Verifies the deck selector on the ingest corners page has the expected
structure: deck dropdown with "Create new deck" option and zone selector
with Mainboard/Sideboard/Commander options.

The deck selector is hidden by default (display:none) and only shown
after detection results exist. We use JS to reveal it, simulating
the post-detection state.
