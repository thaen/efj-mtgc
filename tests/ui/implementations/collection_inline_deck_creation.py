"""
Hand-written implementation for collection_inline_deck_creation.

Creates a new deck inline from the card modal's per-copy "Add to Deck"
dropdown using the "New Deck..." option. Uses Condemn (SPG, index 26)
which is unassigned. The prompt dialog is auto-accepted with "Test View"
by the test harness.
