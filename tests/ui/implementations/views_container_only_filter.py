"""
Hand-written implementation for views_container_only_filter.

Loads the "Unassigned Cards" saved view which has container=unassigned
and an empty search query. Previously this did nothing because the
view-select handler only called fetchCollection() when f.q was truthy.
Verifies that unassigned cards appear and assigned cards do not.
