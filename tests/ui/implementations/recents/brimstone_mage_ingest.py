"""
Brimstone Mage is inserted by --demo as READY_FOR_OCR. The server (with
MTGC_FAKE_AGENT=1) processes it on startup: OCR runs locally, fake agent
returns two candidates, but _resolve_candidates fails on unicode artist
mismatch ("Volkan Baga" vs "Volkan Bağa") — card lands as
needs_disambiguation with empty scryfall_matches.

Open the accordion, search for the card, select a candidate, verify green.

Requires MTGC_FAKE_AGENT=1 and ROE cached in the fixture DB.
