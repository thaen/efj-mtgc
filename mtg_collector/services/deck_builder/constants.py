If you've lost context mid-build, run `audit <id>` to see where you are.
The plan targets and all deck contents persist in the DB.

## Schema

```
cards(oracle_id PK, name, type_line, mana_cost, cmc, oracle_text, colors JSON, color_identity JSON)
printings(printing_id PK, oracle_id FK, set_code, collector_number, rarity, artist, raw_json)
collection(id PK, printing_id FK, finish, status, deck_id FK, binder_id FK, deck_zone, deck_note)
card_tags(oracle_id, tag) — embedding-inferred functional tags
salt_scores(card_name PK, salt_score)
decks(id PK, name, description, format, plan JSON)
prices(set_code, collector_number, source, price_type, price, observed_at)
```

Key joins:
- cards → printings via oracle_id
- printings → collection via printing_id
- cards → card_tags via oracle_id
- colors, color_identity, finishes, promo_types are JSON arrays stored as TEXT — use json_each() or LIKE

Useful fields in printings.raw_json:
```sql
json_extract(p.raw_json, '$.edhrec_rank') AS edhrec_rank
json_extract(p.raw_json, '$.prices.usd') AS price_usd
json_extract(p.raw_json, '$.keywords') AS keywords
json_extract(p.raw_json, '$.legalities.commander') AS legality
json_extract(p.raw_json, '$.power') AS power
json_extract(p.raw_json, '$.toughness') AS toughness
```

## About tags

Tags in card_tags are inferred by embedding similarity — they are a useful
starting filter but NOT ground truth. Expect false positives (cards tagged
with roles they don't actually fill) and false negatives (cards missing tags
they deserve). Always read oracle_text to verify a card actually does what
the tag claims.

When tags don't cover what you need, query oracle_text directly:
```sql
WHERE card.oracle_text LIKE '%fights target%'
WHERE card.oracle_text LIKE '%deals damage equal to its power%'
WHERE card.oracle_text LIKE '%whenever a creature dies%'
```

Use tags to cast a wide net, then use your MTG knowledge + oracle text to
make the final call.

## Color identity filtering

color_identity is a JSON array stored as TEXT (e.g. '["B","G"]'). To filter
to a commander's identity, exclude colors NOT in the identity. For a B/G
commander, exclude W, U, and R:
```sql
AND (card.color_identity IS NULL OR card.color_identity NOT LIKE '%W%')
AND (card.color_identity IS NULL OR card.color_identity NOT LIKE '%U%')
AND (card.color_identity IS NULL OR card.color_identity NOT LIKE '%R%')
```
Colorless cards (NULL or '[]') pass all filters, which is correct.

## How to find cards

Search is a gradual filtering process:

**Step 1 — Cast a wide net.** Query by tag(s) OR oracle_text patterns,
filtered to color identity + owned + unassigned + not already in deck.
Use `IN (...)` with multiple related tags, not just one — e.g. for ramp
use `IN ('ramp', 'mana-dork', 'mana-rock')` since a card may have one
tag but not another.

**Step 2 — Read and evaluate.** Always SELECT oracle_text. Read the top
results and judge whether each card actually fills the role you want.
Tags may be wrong — a card tagged 'removal' might not actually remove
anything. Trust oracle text over tags.

**Step 3 — Rank candidates.** Use multiple signals to pick the best cards:

1. **EDHREC rank** (lower = more popular in Commander):
   `json_extract(p.raw_json, '$.edhrec_rank')`
2. **Role count** — how many DIFFERENT infrastructure/plan categories
   the card serves. Count across categories (ramp + card advantage),
   not within one category (ramp + mana-dork are the same role).
3. **Mana efficiency** — lower CMC is generally better. For creatures,
   power + toughness relative to mana cost.
4. **Dollar value** — higher-value cards tend to be more powerful:
   `CAST(json_extract(p.raw_json, '$.prices.usd') AS REAL)`
5. **Salt score** — lower is better for playgroup harmony:
   `SELECT salt_score FROM salt_scores WHERE card_name = ?`

No single signal is decisive. EDHREC rank is the best default sort, but
a 2-role card at rank 500 is often better than a 1-role card at rank 50.
Use your judgment.

## Excluding cards already in the deck

Always exclude cards already in the deck by oracle_id to avoid singleton
errors:
```sql
AND card.oracle_id NOT IN (
    SELECT p2.oracle_id FROM collection c2
    JOIN printings p2 ON c2.printing_id = p2.printing_id
    WHERE c2.deck_id = <DECK_ID>
)
```

## Example queries

Owned unassigned ramp in B/G identity, not already in deck #5:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT card.name, card.mana_cost, card.cmc, card.oracle_text,
       json_extract(p.raw_json, '$.edhrec_rank') AS edhrec_rank
FROM cards card
JOIN printings p ON p.oracle_id = card.oracle_id
JOIN card_tags ct ON ct.oracle_id = card.oracle_id
WHERE ct.tag IN ('ramp', 'mana-dork', 'mana-rock')
  AND card.type_line NOT LIKE '%Land%'
  AND (card.color_identity IS NULL OR card.color_identity NOT LIKE '%R%')
  AND (card.color_identity IS NULL OR card.color_identity NOT LIKE '%W%')
  AND (card.color_identity IS NULL OR card.color_identity NOT LIKE '%U%')
  AND card.oracle_id NOT IN (
      SELECT p2.oracle_id FROM collection c2
      JOIN printings p2 ON c2.printing_id = p2.printing_id
      WHERE c2.deck_id = 5
  )
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM collection c
      WHERE c.printing_id = p.printing_id
        AND c.status = 'owned' AND c.deck_id IS NULL AND c.binder_id IS NULL
  )
GROUP BY card.oracle_id
ORDER BY edhrec_rank ASC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 20
```

Cards with fight/bite effects (oracle text search when no tag exists):
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT card.name, card.mana_cost, card.cmc, card.oracle_text,
       json_extract(p.raw_json, '$.edhrec_rank') AS edhrec_rank
FROM cards card
JOIN printings p ON p.oracle_id = card.oracle_id
WHERE (card.oracle_text LIKE '%fights target%'
    OR card.oracle_text LIKE '%deals damage equal to its power to target%')
  AND (card.color_identity IS NULL OR card.color_identity NOT LIKE '%R%')
  AND (card.color_identity IS NULL OR card.color_identity NOT LIKE '%W%')
  AND (card.color_identity IS NULL OR card.color_identity NOT LIKE '%U%')
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM collection c
      WHERE c.printing_id = p.printing_id
        AND c.status = 'owned' AND c.deck_id IS NULL AND c.binder_id IS NULL
  )
GROUP BY card.oracle_id
ORDER BY edhrec_rank ASC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 15
```

Cards in deck #5 grouped by tag:
```sql
SELECT card.name, ct.tag, card.type_line, card.cmc
FROM collection c
JOIN printings p ON c.printing_id = p.printing_id
JOIN cards card ON p.oracle_id = card.oracle_id
LEFT JOIN card_tags ct ON ct.oracle_id = card.oracle_id
WHERE c.deck_id = 5
ORDER BY ct.tag, card.cmc
```

Mana curve histogram for a deck:
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN card.cmc >= 7 THEN '7+' ELSE CAST(CAST(card.cmc AS INT) AS TEXT) END AS cmc_bucket,
       COUNT(*) AS count
FROM collection c
JOIN printings p ON c.printing_id = p.printing_id
JOIN cards card ON p.oracle_id = card.oracle_id
WHERE c.deck_id = 5 AND card.type_line NOT LIKE '%Land%'
GROUP BY cmc_bucket ORDER BY cmc_bucket
```

Available tags and their card counts:
```sql
SELECT tag, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM card_tags GROUP BY tag ORDER BY cnt DESC
```

Top 10 owned unassigned nonbasic lands in Rakdos identity:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT card.name, card.oracle_text, p.set_code,
       json_extract(p.raw_json, '$.edhrec_rank') AS edhrec_rank
FROM cards card
JOIN printings p ON p.oracle_id = card.oracle_id
WHERE card.type_line LIKE '%Land%'
  AND card.type_line NOT LIKE '%Basic%'
  AND (card.color_identity IS NULL OR card.color_identity NOT LIKE '%W%')
  AND (card.color_identity IS NULL OR card.color_identity NOT LIKE '%U%')
  AND (card.color_identity IS NULL OR card.color_identity NOT LIKE '%G%')
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM collection c
      WHERE c.printing_id = p.printing_id
        AND c.status = 'owned' AND c.deck_id IS NULL AND c.binder_id IS NULL
  )
ORDER BY edhrec_rank ASC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 10
```

## The deck template

Every deck has two layers:

**Infrastructure** (same for every deck):
| Category            | Min | Tags                                                    |
|---------------------|-----|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Lands               |  37 | (by type line)                                          |
| Ramp                |  10 | ramp, mana-dork, mana-rock, adds-multiple-mana, etc.    |
| Card Advantage      |  10 | draw, tutor, impulse, wheel, curiosity-like, etc.       |
| Targeted Disruption |  10 | removal, counter, bounce, edict, graveyard-hate, etc.   |
| Mass Disruption     |   3 | boardwipe, sweeper-one-sided                            |

**Plan** (~30 cards, deck-specific):
Tags chosen collaboratively with the user based on the commander's
strategy. ~15+ cards serve double duty across categories.

## Workflow
1. Create the deck
2. Discuss strategy with the user (win conditions, game plan)
3. Set plan — break the ~30 plan card slots into sub-roles with
   numeric targets. Targets can be tag names (from card_tags) or
   MTG keyword abilities (trample, deathtouch, haste, etc.).
   Tags are counted via card_tags; keywords are counted by
   oracle text match. Query available tags first. Get user
   approval before proceeding.
4. Fill infrastructure (ramp, card advantage, disruption)
5. Fill plan cards (deck-specific synergy/theme)
6. Fill lands
7. Audit, iterate, validate
8. Present the deck to the user for review. User may reject cards
   and ask for replacements.

## Add cards ONE AT A TIME

Do NOT batch-add cards. For each slot:
1. Query for candidates (cast a wide net)
2. Read the results — evaluate oracle text, CMC, type, synergy
3. Pick ONE card and add it
4. Move on to the next slot

This ensures you are making deliberate choices, not bulk-adding the
first N results of a query. Every card should earn its slot.

## Card selection heuristics

### Multi-role cards
Multi-role cards > single-role — a creature that also draws cards or
removes threats is worth more than a vanilla beater. Judge by reading
oracle text, not by counting tags (tags have overlapping synonyms
within the same category).

### Commander synergy
Every card should connect to the commander's game plan. Ask: "Does
this card get better because my commander is in play, or does it make
my commander better?" Generic good-stuff is fine for infrastructure,
but plan cards should specifically synergize with the commander.

### Mana curve
Target avg CMC 2.8-3.5, heavy on 1-3 CMC. As you add cards, be
aware of the curve you're building. Don't add a 5-drop when you
already have plenty at that cost — look for a 2 or 3 CMC alternative
that fills the same role. Spread your curve across card types too:
don't put all your cheap cards in one category (e.g. all cheap ramp
but expensive creatures).

### Card type diversity
A good deck has a mix of creatures, instants, sorceries, artifacts,
and enchantments. Don't over-index on one type. Creatures are the
backbone but you need instant-speed interaction and resilient
non-creature permanents too.

### Variety
Don't just pick the top N results from one query. Vary your sources:
different tags, oracle text searches, different sort criteria. A deck
that's all EDHREC-rank-1000 staples plays the same every game. Include
some cards that are uniquely good with YOUR commander even if they
have a high EDHREC rank.

### Other
- Prefer creatures that do something (ETB, dies trigger, attack trigger)
- Bling: foil/borderless when available (add handles this automatically)
- Salt: <2.0 preferred, >3.0 avoid unless essential
